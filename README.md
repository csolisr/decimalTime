decimalTime
===========

decimalTime is a straightforward implementation of how to write and
display a date and time in decimal notation, either worldwide or
local based on legacy timezones. Years are counted from the Unix
Epoch (Jan. 1st, 1970 in legacy time), time is counted by number of
days elapsed during the year, plus the fragment of day already
elapsed up to five decimal digits (deciday, centiday, milliday,
decimilliday, centimilliday). As of yet, decimal time has been only
implemented for terrestrial dates, hence the T suffix after the year.
Worldwide time is indicated by an M suffix, while local timezones use
a L prefix followed by two digits that score the amount of offset
from legacy UTC.

Sample worldwide date: 43T364.84167M

Sample local date for UTC-6: 43T364.59167L-06
